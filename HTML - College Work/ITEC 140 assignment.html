          <h1>System vulnerability and Computer Crimes</h1>
          <p>Assignment fulfilled in the class <span>"ITEC 140: Commercial and Industrial Information Systems,"</span> with discussion on system vulnerabilities and possible crimes that can occur, including malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Hackers were also an issue in computer crime, as were employees who were not loyal to the company, with the possibility of stealing important documents, injecting dangerous software into systems, and more. Computer crime is a serious issue and can have negative consequences if caught. A valuable lesson was learned in this assignment in relation to computer crimes and the different issues that can occur. </p>
