          <h1>History of Windows</h1>
          <p>Final Project for the class <span>"ITEC 122: Introduction to Operating Systems"</span> in relation to the history of Windows, starting from Windows 1.0, released in 1985, until Windows 11, released in 2021. Windows device management, including the I/O manager, device driver, and more, were mentioned. Additionally, Windows process management, including process creation and scheduling, priority levels, and more, as well as memory management containing the kernel, memory protection and pools, and a lot more, were also discussed within the project. During the completion of this project, I was able to learn a lot and gain in-depth knowledge of the Windows operating systems.</p>
