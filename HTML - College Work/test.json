A discussion of the evolution of telecommunication over the years was also included, as were some examples of telecommunication with advantages such as saving time and gasoline rather than traveling from one point to another to communicate. While there are in fact a lot of advantages, some may still find it difficult to understand or unable to access it in rural areas. This project taught a valuable lesson on the reasons for telecommunications use and the benefits of it to society.",
