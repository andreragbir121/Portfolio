          <h1>Asteroid Evasion Project Management</h1>
          <p>Final Project for the class <span>"ITEC 115: Introduction to Project Management"</span>, accomplished within a group of five with the objective of planning a project that resulted in a video game called Asteroid Evasion featuring a space-themed adventure in both 2D and 3D. The game consisted of many features, as reported throughout the document. The project was split into sections so that each team member was able to participate. Different sections of the portfolio include business value, brand identity and value, technological differentiation, competitive environment, and more. </p>
