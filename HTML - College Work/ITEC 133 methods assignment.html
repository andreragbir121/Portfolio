          <h1>Methods in JAVA</h1>
          <p>Program created in the class <span>"ITEC 133: Introduction to Programming,"</span> using different methods, including a method for calculating the hypotenuse of specific numbers by taking user input for height and width and using math functions for calculation; a second method for getting menu options based on user input and using a switch statement for each input; and a third method for calculating the sum of squared numbers between 0 and the input given by the user. Math functions were used to find the square of numbers along with the sum. and finally, a palindrome checker that used a for loop to iterate through a word and determine if it was a palindrome or not; the program would output a statement instructing whether it was a palindrome or not. </p>        </div>
