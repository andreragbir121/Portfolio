          <h1>Brain-Blitz: Galaxy</h1>
          <p>finalized in the class <span>"ITEC 229: Human Computer Interface,"</span>> with the objective of designing software for an intended purpose. I decided to design a game designated for children below the age of 18 to enhance learning with the use of a phone. Due to the fact that they are being introduced to it at a very young age, it becomes an addiction. The game featured various levels such as alphabet learning, counting, and basic math operations, concluding with a challenging equation level. I designed documentation and conducted a survey for parents with children under 18, enhancing my skills for creating user-friendly software in the future.</p>
