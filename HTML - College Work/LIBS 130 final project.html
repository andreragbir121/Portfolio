          <h1>The Dark Side of Online Gaming</h1>
          <p>Final Assignment completed in the class <span>"LIBS 130: Fundamental Research Skills"</span>, with the objective of creating a research paper based on the topic of negative effects of online gaming on youths. Some issues highlighted included poor sleep hygiene, disappointing academic performance, and a lack of physical socializing. Through out this course and assignment, I was able to increase my knowledge of researching through the internet for factual and non-factual information, as well as properly referencing sources to avoid plagiarism.</span>.</p>
