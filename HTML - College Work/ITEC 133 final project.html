          <h1>GPA calculator using JAVA</h1>
          <p>
            Final project to conclude the class <span>"ITEC 133: Introduction to Programming,"</span> Using Intelij, I was able to create a program that was capable of taking a student's full name and student ID, along with their current academic year and semester, and the total courses enrolled in for the semester. The program was capable of calculating the total GPA of the student based on the number of courses and credits per course. A switch statement was used in order to return the respective grade based on the GPA. This final project enabled a valuable lesson for my journey in programming by giving me in-depth knowledge of using a switch statement properly.</p>
