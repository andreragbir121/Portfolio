          <h1>Suzuki Ignis Advertisement</h1>
          <p>Instagram advertisement created in the class <span>"GRDE 129: Introduction to Graphic Design,"</span> presenting the Suzuki Ignis by utilizing the software Adobe Illustrator and tools such as scaling, cropping for getting the best-suited image size, dragging and dropping for the best position, and stylish fonts to enhance the appearance. A lot was learned from this assignment in relation to using Adobe Illustrator, and it was a great experience for exploring the creative side of my mind. </span>.</p>
